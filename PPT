Slide 3: Overview of the Legacy WebForms Application

ASP.NET WebForms: Monolithic architecture

Key Challenges:

Difficult to scale

Outdated UI and server-side logic

Performance bottlenecks




---

Slide 4: Why Migrate to Angular and .NET API

Key Drivers:

Modern, dynamic user experience with Angular

Decoupled, stateless architecture with .NET API

Scalability and flexibility through OpenShift


Benefits:

Improved User Experience: Responsive, modern UI

Easier Maintenance: Separation of frontend and backend

Scalability: Independent scaling of frontend and backend




---

Slide 5: New Architecture and OpenShift Deployment

Frontend (Angular):

Dynamic, responsive UI interacting with the backend via HTTP


Backend (.NET API):

Stateless RESTful API handling business logic


Deployment (OpenShift):

Containerized Angular and .NET API services

Automatic scaling and CI/CD pipelines




---

Slide 6: Architecture Diagram (Visual)

Frontend (Angular)

Backend (.NET API)

OpenShift: Container orchestration, pods, scaling

Dynatrace: Performance monitoring

Splunk: Centralized logging


(Include a simplified architecture diagram to visually represent the system)


---

Slide 7: Integration of Dynatrace and Splunk

Dynatrace Monitoring:

Real-time performance insights for Angular & .NET API

End-to-end request tracing

Alerts and anomaly detection


Splunk Logging:

Centralized log aggregation from both frontend and backend

Query logs, dashboards, and real-time issue tracking




---

Slide 8: Live Demo Overview

Angular Frontend:

Responsive and dynamic user interface


.NET API:

Stateless API handling requests efficiently


OpenShift Dashboard:

Real-time container management and scaling


Dynatrace Monitoring:

Tracing requests from frontend to backend


Splunk Logs:

Real-time log aggregation and analysis




---

Slide 9: Benefits of Migration

Scalability & Performance:

OpenShift ensures independent scaling of frontend and backend.

Dynatrace provides proactive system monitoring.


Improved User Experience:

Angular offers faster, more dynamic interfaces.


Efficient Monitoring & Debugging:

Splunk simplifies log management and analysis.




---

Slide 10: Challenges Faced

Learning Curve:

Transitioning to Angular, .NET API, OpenShift required upskilling.


Legacy Code Refactoring:

Migrating business logic from WebForms to a stateless API involved significant code refactoring.




---

Slide 11: Conclusion

Successful migration from ASP.NET WebForms to a scalable, modular architecture using Angular and .NET API.

Deployed using OpenShift for scalability and performance.

Dynatrace and Splunk have enhanced monitoring and observability.

Thank you!

Any questions?

Slide 12: Architecture Diagram (Expanded) (Optional Slide)

If you want to go deeper into architecture during the demo, consider an additional slide to break down container deployment, API endpoints, scaling strategy, and logging/monitoring flow with Dynatrace and Splunk.



---

Notes for Speaker (For Demo Slide)

For Slide 8 (Live Demo Overview), as you present, show the live UI in Angular and use Postman for API testing.

Show OpenShift’s dashboard to display how the containers are deployed and managed.

Use Dynatrace to highlight real-time monitoring and demonstrate Splunk logs by querying logs related to recent operations.
