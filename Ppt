To help you prepare for a PowerPoint presentation on deploying an Angular and .NET application to OpenShift, here's an outline of the slides and key points you can include in each:


---

Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: Deploying Angular & .NET Application to OpenShift

Subtitle: Overview of Architecture, Process, and Best Practices

Presented by: [Your Name]

Date



---

Slide 2: Introduction

Overview: Introduction to Angular frontend, .NET backend, and OpenShift platform.

Key Points:

What is Angular (brief overview).

What is .NET (API/backend technologies).

What is OpenShift (Kubernetes-based platform).




---

Slide 3: Architecture Overview

Diagram: Display the architecture of the application, showing how Angular (frontend) interacts with .NET (API/backend) and how both are deployed in OpenShift.

Key Components:

Angular Frontend

.NET Core API

OpenShift Pods and Services

Routing, Load Balancing, and Network Layers




---

Slide 4: Prerequisites for Deployment

Tools and Requirements:

Angular: Ensure the frontend is compiled using ng build for production.

.NET: The API is packaged for deployment using Docker or similar.

OpenShift CLI (oc): Used for managing OpenShift resources.

Dockerfile: A working Dockerfile for both Angular and .NET applications.




---

Slide 5: Building Angular & .NET Docker Images

Angular:

Explain how to create a Dockerfile for Angular (e.g., using Nginx to serve static files).

ng build --prod to create production files.

Example of a Dockerfile for Angular.


.NET:

Build Docker image for .NET using dotnet publish.

Example of a Dockerfile for the .NET API.




---

Slide 6: Pushing Docker Images to OpenShift Registry

Step-by-Step:

Log in to OpenShift and push images to the internal registry.

Command: oc login to authenticate.

Push Docker images using docker push or integrate with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.).




---

Slide 7: Deploying Angular & .NET to OpenShift

Step-by-Step Deployment:

Create OpenShift Projects (oc new-project <project_name>).

Deploy backend services (e.g., .NET API) using oc new-app.

Deploy frontend Angular using oc new-app.

Setup routes for external access using oc expose svc <service-name>.




---

Slide 8: Configuring OpenShift for Scale

Scaling and Auto-scaling:

Define resource limits and configure horizontal pod autoscalers.

Command: oc autoscale dc/<deployment-config> --min 1 --max 10 --cpu-percent 80.

Ensure the application is ready for high traffic and scaling needs.




---

Slide 9: Monitoring and Logging

OpenShift Monitoring:

Use built-in OpenShift monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time metrics.

Ensure logging (e.g., using EFK stack: Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) is enabled for tracing issues in the deployment.




---

Slide 10: Best Practices

Recommendations:

Use OpenShiftâ€™s CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration.

Ensure images are scanned for vulnerabilities.

Perform rolling updates for zero downtime during deployment.

Use environment variables for configuration in OpenShift to avoid hardcoded values.




---

Slide 11: Challenges & Solutions

Common Issues:

Networking issues between Angular and .NET services.

Handling environment-specific configurations (Dev vs. Production).

Solutions: DNS-based service discovery in OpenShift, using OpenShift secrets and config maps for dynamic configurations.




---

Slide 12: Q&A

Invite questions: Open the floor for questions from the team and encourage discussions around specific challenges or ideas related to the deployment.



---

Slide 13: Conclusion

Summary:

Recap the deployment process from building, pushing images, deploying to OpenShift, and scaling.

Highlight the benefits of using OpenShift for Angular & .NET deployments.
